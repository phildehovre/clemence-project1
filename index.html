                <p>
                    Each grief journey is unique, but creating the emotional, mental, and physical space is ​essential to helping 
                    you process complicated emotions. We are socialised to hide and hold on to pain and suffering, and this can be
                    ​exhausting, isolating, and counter-productive to healing. <br>
                    <br>
                    Griefwell is about ​helping you build the tools and 
                    environment to better process loss and grief, ​and empower you to be the leader of your own grief journey.
                    Time doesn’t heal a broken heart, but small actions and clear spaces can help ​you move forward.

                <p> Many of us associate grief with a bereavement, and losing someone is one of the most ​significant losses one can 
                    ever experience. However, many other losses can also lead to a ​profound sense of grief; loss of health or career, 
                    divorce, infertility, etc... <br>
                    <br>
                    Early mid-life is when many women start to identify more losses and those losses start ​to impact our wellbeing. 
                    We may start to experience the death of a parent or ageing ​parents, poor health, infertility, divorce, change or 
                    loss of career, and many other losses. ​And we sometimes view these losses as a failure, suffer alone, and feel 
                    overwhelmed. <br>
                    <br>
                    Some losses impact us forever and it is important we have a toolkit and clear and safe ​spaces to explore our 
                    relationship with grief so we can grow and heal alongside it. <br>
